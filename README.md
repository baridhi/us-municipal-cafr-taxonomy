Proposed XBRL taxonomy for audited financial statements produced by US state and local governments
About 30,000 US state and local governments produce audited financial statements each year. Because these financial reports typically appear in PDF format, they are difficult to analyze and compare. By tranisitioning from PDFs to machine readable disclosures, we can ultimately create a publicly accessible database of audited state and local government financial statistics.

The taxonomy is based on a peer reviewed article published by Professors Neal Snow and Jacqueline Reck in the Journal of Information Systems in 2016. A draft of this article is freely available on the Social Science Research Network, and the published article is available to journal subscibers or for purchase.

The repo also contains an Excel workbook with VBA code that can generate compliant XBRL instance documents. To unlock sheets in this workbook, please use password Micro#16Vista; to see and modify the VBA code use password daolpu@16#. There is also a docx file containing tagged footnotes that can be emedded in the instance document. 

During Summer 2018, this repo was transferred to XBRL US.  Further updates will be made and shared among XBRL US members.
